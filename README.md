Please be considerate towards reviewers/maintainers when raising issues or presenting pull requests. Let's show the world that LaravelUK members are civilized and great people to work with.

## Submission Requirements
Before submitting a pull request:
- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.
- Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.
- Send coherent history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate - commits while developing, please [squash] (http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) them before submitting.
- It is important to add tests to your functionality, even if it is a very simple feature. If it is a UI change, it will be helpful to add a simple screenshot with a brief note so others will know what has changed
- If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

### Feedback Policy

We will strive for a "Zero Pull Request Pending" policy. This means, that if the pull request is good, it will be merged as soon as review is completed and if it does not meet the requirements, the contributor will be advised to make changes and re-submit.


### Coding Standards
As this is a Laravel application, we will be following the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standard.
 - Interfaces should NOT be suffixed with Interface, Traits should NOT be suffixed with Trait
 - Class and method names must be descriptive enough with type-hints since we are not enforcing docblocks
 - Ensure that you submit tests that have minimal 100% coverage.
